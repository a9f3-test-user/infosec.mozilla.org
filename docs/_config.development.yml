# See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/

# This config is used for the copy of the site hosted at mozilla.github.io/infosec.mozilla.org/dev/
# The only two differences this config has from _config.yml are
# * The "environment" is "development" in this config and "production" in _config.yml
# * The "baseurl" is "/infosec.mozilla.org/dev" in this config and "/" in _config.yml
# This additional copy of the site is published to the /dev/ path via the GitHub Action
# This allows for viewing the site on a fork before PRing or merging into the upstream
# For example, this copy of the site could be seen at https://octocat.gihub.io/infosec.mozilla.org/dev/
# if octocat had forked the mozilla/infosec.mozilla.org repo
environment: development

# To use the dev site you will need to enable GitHub pages on your fork in the repo's settings

theme: jekyll-theme-slate
# This baseurl sets all the links to the correct path for the dev site
baseurl: /infosec.mozilla.org/dev
sass:
    sass_dir: _sass
